Introductory programming class term project. Takes CMU's schedule of classes, 
parses the information. Displays the class the user searches for, and adds it 
to a weekly schedule, where it can be removed. All programmed from scratch in python.

Contents of this repository: 
two versions of the program as python files, 
Schedule.py: an early and unfinished version
Schedulev2.py: the main code for what ultimately became the final version (I have misplaced the
original file that I used as my final version, this is the closest thing I could find)

and one that has been packaged as a Mac OS executable program which
should function regardless of one's python installation.

There are no plans to add or update to this in the future. It was a project that could have
been implemented better given what I know now, but regardless there are better applications online 
that serve the same purpose.
